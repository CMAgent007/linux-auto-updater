### üìò Description  
Linux Auto-Updater is a Bash script designed to simplify system package management across major Linux distributions. With a one-time interactive setup, it installs itself as a persistent background job and ensures your system stays up-to-date ‚Äî without further manual intervention.

- **Interactive Setup**: Prompts you to choose a daily or weekly update schedule  
- **One-Time Install**: Installs as a system-wide command and configures a cron job  
- **Multi-Distro Support**: Detects and uses the correct package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, or `pacman`)  
- **Background Operation**: Runs silently on your schedule without user input  
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs all activity to `/var/log/auto_system_updates.log`
